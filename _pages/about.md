About me
------
I am a PhD student at ONERA and LIRMM. My research interests are Computer Vision and Autonomous Robotics applied to Underwater Autonomous Vehicles and Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles.
In the context of my thesis, my researches will be focus on Visual SLAM, multi-sensors fusion and 3D reconstruction. Every aspects of the needs for the development of such a technology will be investigated, from the choice of the cameras to the choice of the computing units for real-time processing. My contributions will be about robust localization for underwater operating robots, 3D modeling and relocalization in previously mapped areas while updating these maps. All of these algorithms will be developed to work in real-time.
This thesis is supervised by Dr. Vincent Creuze (LIRMM), Dr. Julien Moras (ONERA), Dr. Pauline Trouv√© (ONERA).
